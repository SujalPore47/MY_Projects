It explains the mathematical principles behind this technology and provides a multi-faceted view, examining models, systems, and applications.  The article explores the social impact of Generative AI, particularly its influence on human-AI interaction and the emergence of \"hybrid intelligence.\" \n\nWhile highlighting its potential, the article also acknowledges four major limitations: inaccurate outputs, bias and fairness issues, copyright infringement concerns, and environmental impact. Finally, it discusses research opportunities for the Business & Information Systems Engineering (BISE) community, emphasizing areas like business process management, decision analytics, and human-computer interaction. \n\n**CSV Data Summary:**\n\nThe CSV file contains data for 100 individuals, with each row representing a unique customer. The dataset includes information such as customer ID, name, company, location, contact details, subscription date, and website.  The data is consistent, with 100 unique values for each column except for 'Index', which has an average value of 50.5. \n"
